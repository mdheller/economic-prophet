# economic-prophet

Open, auditable economic-profit framework and near-real-time profitability intelligence engine.

## Purpose

This repository layers the work from the economic-profit white paper into:
- canonical documentation
- machine-readable schemas
- a reference Python implementation
- synthetic examples and audit outputs

## Repository plan

### Phase 1 — framework as documentation
- `docs/whitepaper.md`
- `docs/product_spec.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/integrations.md`
- `schemas/`

### Phase 2 — framework as first-class modeling and simulation platform
- `src/open_ep_framework/`
- zero-EP pricing solver
- FTP engine
- expected-loss engine
- recovery surface engine
- capital charge engine
- attribution engine
- relationship portfolio effects
- relationship context outputs
- object graph runtime
- product object loaders
- instrument context outputs
- lineage-aware EP outputs
- context output schemas
- Heller mesh measurement runtime
- audit pack generation

### Phase 3 — ValueFlows / MPCC / energy alignment
- `docs/valueflows_mpcc_energy_alignment.md`
- ValueFlows-compatible economic graph objects
- MPCC-compatible event envelopes
- energy stock/flow/conversion semantics
- Heller mesh crosswalk as an internal measurement projection

## Quick start

```bash
python -m pip install -e . pytest
python -m pytest -q
python -m open_ep_framework.cli --example examples/synthetic_run.json --audit audit.json
python -m open_ep_framework.cli --mode instrument-context --example examples/synthetic_run.json --object-id instrument-loan-001 --audit instrument_context_audit.json
python -m open_ep_framework.cli --mode relationship --example examples/synthetic_relationship_runtime.json --audit relationship_audit.json
python -m open_ep_framework.cli --mode relationship-context --example examples/synthetic_relationship_runtime.json --relationship-object-id rel-synthetic-001 --audit relationship_context_audit.json
python -m open_ep_framework.cli --mode object-graph --example examples/object_graph.json --object-id instrument-loan-001 --audit object_graph_audit.json
python -m open_ep_framework.cli --mode object-context --object-id instrument-loan-001 --audit object_context_audit.json
python -m open_ep_framework.cli --mode heller-mesh --example examples/heller_mesh_measurement.json --audit heller_mesh_audit.json
```

The instrument CLI emits:
- FTP rate
- expected loss
- planning recovery
- market-implied recovery
- recovery wedge
- capital charge
- zero-EP break-even rate
- audit pack

The instrument-context CLI emits the same instrument calculation with joined object context: lineage, account, instrument, transaction event, collateral set, funding source, and hedge set.

The relationship CLI emits:
- weighted instrument break-even rate
- capital diversification credit
- collateral overlap charge
- utilization interaction charge
- franchise / cross-sell credit
- relationship required rate
- audit pack

The relationship-context CLI emits the same relationship calculation with relationship lineage from the object graph.

The object-graph CLI emits lineage-aware EP output for a selected object and writes the same auditable run record format. Object graph files are validated against `schemas/canonical_object.schema.json` during load.

The object-context CLI emits a joined runtime context for a selected instrument, including object lineage, account, instrument, transaction event, collateral set, funding source, and hedge set.

The Heller mesh CLI emits a validated internal measurement run for the Heller flywheel mechanics: sphere states, transfer-pricing edges, triparty faces, Micro/Credit/Reserve supply, reserve adequacy, credit utilization, gross-to-net compression, and auditable run hashes.

## ValueFlows / MPCC / energy alignment

Economic Prophet now treats ValueFlows as the economic graph grammar, energy semantics as the stock/flow/conversion/capacity grammar, MPCC as the provenance/authority/causality grammar, Economic Prophet as the profitability measurement runtime, and Heller mesh as a specialized internal economic-mechanics projection.

See `docs/valueflows_mpcc_energy_alignment.md`.

## Context output schemas

The repository includes formal schemas for context-aware runtime outputs:
- `schemas/instrument_context_output.schema.json`
- `schemas/relationship_context_output.schema.json`
- `schemas/context_audit_record.schema.json`

These schemas make instrument and relationship context outputs testable as auditable product surfaces.

## Heller mesh measurement mechanics

The repository now includes a schema-first measurement boundary for the Heller flywheel economy:
- `docs/heller_mesh_measurement.md`
- `schemas/heller_mesh_measurement.schema.json`
- `examples/heller_mesh_measurement.json`
- `src/open_ep_framework/heller_mesh.py`
- `tests/test_heller_mesh.py`

This mode treats Economic Prophet as the measurement engine, Heller as the internal economic mechanics, and governed triparty netting as the release constitution. It does **not** implement live money movement, external token issuance, redemption rights, public-chain settlement, or exchange trading.

## Canonical object model

The runtime is moving toward a typed profitability graph:

```text
legal_entity -> line_of_business -> relationship -> account -> instrument -> transaction_event
```

Supporting objects include collateral sets, funding sources, hedge sets, scenarios, model versions, and parameter sets. See `docs/object_model.md`, `schemas/canonical_object.schema.json`, `schemas/lineage_ep_output.schema.json`, `examples/canonical_object.json`, `examples/object_graph.json`, and `src/open_ep_framework/object_graph.py`.

## Product object schemas and loaders

The repository includes first-pass product object contracts and loaders for:
- account
- instrument
- transaction event
- collateral set
- funding source
- hedge set

Each schema has a matching synthetic fixture under `examples/`, a validation test under `tests/test_product_object_schemas.py`, and loader/join coverage under `tests/test_product_object_loaders.py`.

## Relationship portfolio effects

The relationship engine demonstrates why relationship profitability is not a blind sum of transactions. It decomposes relationship required rate into:
- weighted instrument break-even rate
- capital diversification credit
- collateral overlap charge
- utilization interaction charge
- franchise / cross-sell credit

See `examples/synthetic_relationship_runtime.json`, `schemas/relationship.schema.json`, and `tests/test_relationship_cli.py`.

## Ecosystem integration

This reference implementation is designed to integrate with:
- **Gaia** for macro regime state and scenario conditioning
- **Ontogenesis** for canonical ontology, lineage, and semantic constraints
- **TritFabric** for typed event transport and simulation orchestration
- **ValueFlows** for economic graph semantics
- **MPCC** for event provenance, causality, authority, policy, and effect control
- **energy-system modeling** for stock/flow/conversion/capacity/cost constraints

## First artifacts to land
